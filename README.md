# Personal-Finance-App
Full Stack personal finance app project as a goal to solve a personal problem and for learning purposes. 

#Back-End
For the backend, my language pick will be Rust. Mostly for learning purposes, it's versatility, memory efficiency, and safety features that are very useful for this kind of application.Â  

#Front-End
Here for the time being I will be using mostly HTML, CSS and javascript with either bootstrap, tailwind CSS or Vue.js to create simple core views for the program. As I'm starting with a minimum viable product (MVP)

#DataStorage
I will be using data.json to store and persist the API data. Later on will integrate with a database like PosgreSQL or MongoDB along with Docker containers depending on my application needs.

#Tools
In this section I will be adding all the tools as well as dependencies used for the app.
